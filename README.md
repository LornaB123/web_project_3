**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. It will be displayed correctly on popular screen sizes! 

**Figma**

* [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/xM9rNsdK4iNcFJmDZho3Aw/Sprint-3%3A-From-Portland-to-Portland-%2F-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=500%3A0)

**Images**

Images were exported directly from Figma. They were optimized [here](https://tinypng.com/), so the project loads faster. 

**Technologies Used**

This project worked with the @media screen technology to create a fully responsive web design that can adjust for optimal user experience between multiple screen sizes, ranging from cell phones, tablets, laptops, and large computer screens. Images were optimized for quicker load times. A .nojekyll file is used in the project to allow the BEM methodology to be used in GitHub. Hover effects are used on some links. Both Grid Layout and Flexbox technologies are used for a truly beautiful and interactive design.
